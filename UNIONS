UNION: UNION is used to combine the result of one query with the results of another query.
Things to keep in mind:

1. The results of both queries should contain same number of columns.
2. The results of both queries should have columns of same datatypes.
3. Duplicate rows(rows which have same values for all columns) will be removed as part of normalization.

UNION ALL: UNION ALL is used to combine the result of one query with the results of another query and preserve the duplicate rows.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ... columnN FROM table1
WHERE condition1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ... columnN FROM table2
WHERE condition2;
